# Udacitrivia

Udacitrivia is a website that allows users to create and answer questions in different categories including science, art, geography, history, entertainment, and sports.

Main function of the application:
1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

## Getting Started
* Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration. The frontend app is hosted at the default http://127.0.0.1:3000/
* Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.
### Frontend
#### Installing Dependencies
##### Installing Node and NPM
This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from https://nodejs.com/en/download.
##### Installing project dependencies
This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the frontend directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:
``` npm install ```
#### Running Your Frontend in Dev Mode
The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use npm start. You can change the script in the package.json file.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.
``` npm start ```

### Backend
#### Installing Dependencies
##### Python 3.7
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)
##### Virtual Enviornment
We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
##### PIP Dependencies
Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the /backend directory and running:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the ``` requirements.txt ```file.
###### Key Dependencies
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 
#### Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

#### Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application. 

## Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}
```

The API will return four error types when requests fail:
* 400: Bad Request
* 404: Resource Not Found
* 405: Method Not Allowed
* 422: Not Processable
